            <p class = description><b> Summary of the Project</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>The purpose of this project was to create an inclusive and diverse design through a three-phase project. In the first phase, I unraveled what it meant to design for inclusion and created a design for inclusive tablet menus. In the second phase, I focused on designing for diversity and designed a meal plan for the diverse student population at Wilfrid Laurier University. The meal plan card system would work like a debit or credit card so that it could be used at more locations. The card would have tap, chip, and phone payment options. The locations would be chosen as a result of student input so that there would be a larger variety of food options for a diverse student population. In phase three, I re-evaluated my designs and combined multiple inclusive and diverse aspects of both the initial phases. I expanded my meal plan design by adding more inclusive features to an app that could be downloaded by students. The app would be for budgeting and viewing card balances. Additionally, the app would have adjustable text size and descriptive audio making it more inclusive for those with poor vision or fine-motor skills.</p><br>
                <p class = description><b>Description of the Problem</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>At Wilfrid Laurier University in Brantford, the current meal plan system works at less than ten stores, and these stores sell mainly what can be considered North American style food. The students at Laurier come from many different cultures and backgrounds. By only having food from a single culture available on the meal plan, it stops students from continuing to eat the types of food they prefer or require. It implies that those with specific dietary restrictions due to religion, health requirements, or personal choice are somewhat less important. </p><br>
                <p class = description><b>My Angle</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>Once I identified a possible issue, I began interviewing students to see if this was indeed a problem. Overall, they still liked having a physical meal plan card for convenience purposes, but they were frustrated by the limited food options available with the plan. They also noted that they would like an easier way to check the balance of their card and budget their spending. Next, I started by thinking about how to create a card for diversity. This is when I decided that the card needed to be developed in a way that would work in the current, standard payment machines at restaurants. This way more restaurants would hopefully be willing to accept the card because there would be fewer technological barriers. Students would also be surveyed in order to understand their dietary needs and desires. After visualizing the card through drawings, I also need to make my design more inclusive. I decided on incorporating an app that would have adjustable features for those with disabilities. There were some challenges that I faced with this project. For example, my design is still not fully inclusive or diverse. Some people will still be unable to use the app and card. Those that are not Laurier students are excluded. Additionally, there are only so many restaurants in Brantford, so not every type of food will be able to be bought with the meal plan. An aspect of my design process that did not work well was that I did not do enough user research later on in the project. Next time, I would like to do more prototyping and user testing. An aspect of my design process that did work well was visualizing the design through drawing. This was a helpful way to discover problems and adjust my design. </p><br>
                <p class = description><b>Concluding Evaluation</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>By designing a new meal plan system, I was able to understand more about what it means to design for inclusion and diversity. Including users in the design process was an essential part of creating an inclusive meal plan. During the last phase of the project, I was able to use the knowledge I had gained about inclusive and diverse design from the first two phases. By combining aspects of the initial designs, I created a stronger final design for the meal plan system.</p>

            <p class = description><b> Summary of the Project</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>This design intervention was the first phase of a three-part design project. The focus of this stage was to explore what it means to design for inclusion. The design intervention I created was a tablet menu with inclusive features for those with poor eyesight, limited fine-motor skills, and limited knowledge about technology. The menu would be viewed through an application on a tablet. The menu would have adjustable text size and button size. It would have a descriptive audio option for those with poor eyesight. It would also have a video tutorial and help button for those who may forget how to use the functions of the app such as elderly people. Additionally, there would be an option to translate items on the menu.</p><br>
                <p class = description><b>Description of the Problem</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>Currently, most of the tablet menus found in restaurants in Canada can be challenging for certain individuals to use. First, small text and buttons make ordering difficult for those with poor eyesight or fine-motor skills. Secondly, the menus can also be difficult to use for elderly people or those who have limited knowledge of technology. Thirdly, anyone who does not speak the language that the menu is written in may be unable to order without assistance from a waiter/waitress. When individuals are not able to properly use current tablet menus, they may feel unwelcome at the restaurant. If they have to continuously ask for help during their dining experience, the staff may view them as a burden instead of a valued customer.  </p><br>
                <p class = description><b>My Angle</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>During this project, I did face some challenges. Even after adding the inclusive features that I did, my design was still not inclusive to all individuals. For example, people with complete vision loss would have a very difficult time navigating my design even with the enlarged text and descriptive audio. Furthermore, some people are unable to use touchscreen tablets because of sensory issues, and some may not have a functioning limb to interact with the tablet. In response to these challenges, I do hope that a design can be created in the future that is even more inclusive. Even though it may be impossible to make a tablet menu completely universal, there is still a lot of room for improvement. A lot more user research needs to be done with people with disabilities. Everyone has unique abilities and needs that cannot be understood just through assumptions. Through this project, I learned more about designing for inclusion, and I also learned that though it can be extremely difficult to include all types of people in one design, it is still an important goal to work towards. </p><br>
                <p class = description><b>Concluding Evaluation</b><p>
                <p class = notBold>By designing a tablet menu application, I was able to expand my knowledge about inclusive design. The knowledge that I acquired in this phase was of major importance in the next two phases of the project.</p><br>
