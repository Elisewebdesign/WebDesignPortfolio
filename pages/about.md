<h2><b>Hello!</b></h2>
<p class = description><b> I am a designer and artist from Hamilton, Ontario and am currently studying User Experience Design at Wilfrid Laurier University.</b><p>
<p>I am studying user experience design because I am excited about creating new solutions to common problems and improving existing products/services so that they better meet user needs. I am also interested in visual art, and I spend a lot of my spare time painting and sketching. Computer science is another fascination of mine, and I have enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript.</p>
